	This disk contains a basic CP/M system which  will  work  fine
	with RunCPM.

	Important things about this disk:

	ZSID has been patched for a bug according to  Digital Research
	patches.
	It would add wrong  values  when  entering  16  bit  values in 
	assembly.

	SUBMIT  has  been  patched  for  a  bug  according  to Digital 
	Research patches.
	It would create the $$$.SUB on the current drive, not  on  the
	system drive (A:).
	The original (unpatched) SUBMIT is kept on the disk renamed to
	SUBMITD.COM.

	The DRI BDOS source code (BDOS.ASM) is  included  and  can  be 
	built using BDOS.SUB.
	This source code is the DR original and is included  only  for
	reference.  The  generated  BDOS  image  is  not necessary for 
	RunCPM to run.

	The DRI CCP source code (CCP.ASM) is included and can be built
	using CCP.SUB.
	This  source  code is the DRI's original,  same as the  binary 
	used by RunCPM.
	When building the  DRI's CCP,  adjust the  ORG location on the 
	CCP.ASM accordingly.

	The CCPZ (v4.1) CCP source code (CCPZ.Z80) is included and can
	be built using CCPZ.SUB.
	This source code is the CCPZ original, same as the binary used
	by RunCPM.
	When  building  the  CCPZ CCP,  adjust the ORG location on the
	CCPZ.Z80 file accordingly.

	The ZCPR2 CCP source code (ZCPR2.ASM) is included and  can  be
	built using ZCPR2.SUB.
	This source code is the ZCPR v2 original,  same as the  binary
	used by RunCPM.
	When  building  the ZCPR2 CCP,  adjust the ORG location on the
	Z2HDR.LIB file.

	The ZCPR3 CCP source code (ZCPR2.ASM)  is included and can  be
	built using ZCPR2.SUB.
	This source code is the ZCPR original, same as the binary used
	by RunCPM.
	When building the ZCPR3 CCP,  adjust  the settings accordingly
	on Z3BASE.LIB and Z3HDR.LIB.

	The Z80CCP CCP source code (Z80CCP.ASM) is included and can be
	built using Z80CCP.SUB.
	This source code is the Z80CCP original,  same as  the  binary
	used by RunCPM.
	When building the Z80CCP CCP,  adjust the ORG location on  the
	Z80CCP.ASM file.

	The rights to all the code and software included in this  disk
	belongs to whoever wrote them.

	The extra software  included  other  than  the  official DRI's
	distribution are:

	EXIT - Exits RunCPM.
