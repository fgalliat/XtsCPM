# YatlCPM emulator

for GFX version of emulator :



cd YatlCPM

make posix_sdl build (under Cygwin or WSL)

./YatlCPM (it will fail 'till .CCP files are not present in same dir)



on Win x64 please use XMing (latest version), because XWin (integrated to Cygwin) may not render pixels !!

on Win or Linux - please keep in mind that input is ncurses based & need terminal to be focused...
