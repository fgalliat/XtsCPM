Download, install and import
This library is now available via the Arduino IDE library manager. 
If you are using a modern IDE (1.6.2 or above), you can simply use the menu:

Sketch->Include Library->Manage Libraries... Then search for Keypad.

Once found, click on its entry and the install button will appear. 
The zip file below is for the retro IDE's (not recommended for use, upgrade!).
